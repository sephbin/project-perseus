# Project Perseus

Project Perseus is a reference project that shows how to extract a Revit model and synchronize it with a cloud system. The goal is to create a more open, accessible environment for analysis and collaboration.

This project is likely in a state of flux and may not run as-is, but it should still serve as a useful reference.

A joint venture by Randall Boland and Andrew Butler
